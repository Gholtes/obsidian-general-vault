In their book [[14,495 flats]] (2022), Helen Runting and Rutger Sjögrim explore the new developments of Stockholm that were approved in 2017 in aggregate. In their analysis, they uncover that the developments increasingly optimise their designs to skirt the edge of the legal requirements for new developments, resulting in the final product being close to the true minimum. In this regard, the "minimum has become the new norm".

This is similar to how the planning envelopes strongly influence new developments in Melbourne, with the final shape of the buildings closely resembling the planning envelope that constricted it, leaving little room for considerations of form or aesthetic. 

This idea of the minimum space being the only space produces some interesting outcomes. For example, in Melbourne where all new apartments must have a balcony, one can often see the [[Balcony used as an extra storage space]] rather than a useful outdoor space as it was intended, likely due to a lack of storage spaces in the cramped apartments. 

This also raises a question around [[What the minimum apartment would look like]], and how different it may be from what is already being built.

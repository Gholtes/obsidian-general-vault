To conduct their analysis of the 14,495 flats, the research team measured the interior spaces manually in Adobe Acrobat, a time consuming task. 

Any tool that could provide increased efficiency or automation in this task would allow for more extensive studies for similar nature to 14,495 flats to be conducted, providing insights into the world we are building and must inhabit. As Runting discusses, [[The homes we inhabit impose constraints on our lives]], and an understanding of the homes we are constructing is key to understanding these constraints.

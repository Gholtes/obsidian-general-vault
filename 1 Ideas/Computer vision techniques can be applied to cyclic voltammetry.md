Dr Gareth Kennedy mentioned that the curves produced by cyclic voltammetry in #electrochemistry applications can be analysed with #computervision techniques. Analysis of cyclic voltammetry curves allow for the identification of the sampled substance. 

An application of this technique is the detection of explosives by swabbing a sample with an enzyme coated surface. The enzymes interact with the chemicals in certain explosives, which changes the curve they produce when analysed with cyclic voltammetry techiques.

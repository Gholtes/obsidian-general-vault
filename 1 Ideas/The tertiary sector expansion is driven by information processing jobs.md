In his 2018 book Bullshit Jobs, David Graeber suggests that the increase in the proportion of jobs deemed to be useless by even those who do the job could be explained by the increase in the proportion of jobs in the tertiary services sector. He notes that this sector can be divided into to sub-sectors, the first being the traditional services such as hairdressing, hospitality, retail and the second being information processing jobs in marketing, real estate, insurance, finance and similar. He notes that the proportion of all jobs that fall in the "traditional services" sub-sector has not increased meaningfully, with the rise in the tertiary sector being driven entirely by a rise in information processing jobs.

Philip Ball explores how statistical physics can be applied to human behaviour in his 2004 book "Critical Mass".  Ball explores how "such chemical phenomena as _Phase Transitions_ (think of water suddenly reforming into ice...or steam) are akin to the way societal change can suddenly emerge". Ball explores these ideas by developing phase diagrams for human behaviours, exploring ideas such as how input traffic volumes result in specific traffic *states*. 

The idea that human systems can be in a [[Social metastable states]] is also explored, where the system state is unchanging but is inherently unstable and likely to change state or phase given the right disruption. 

These ideas are further explored in his 2003 paper [[The Physical Modelling of Human Social Systems]]

This creative use of phase diagrams is similar to [[Phase diagrams for exploring non-conventional solution spaces]]

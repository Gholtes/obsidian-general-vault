Philip Ball explores how statistical physics can be applied to human behaviour in his 2004 book "Critical Mass".  Ball explores the idea that human systems can be in a metastable state is also explored, where the system state is unchanging but is inherently unstable and likely to change state or phase given the right disruption. 

This concept is utilised by Dr Gareth Kennedy to predict when a society is in an unstable state and vulnerable to collapse. This was based on research into the boundary between stability and chaos in star systems.

AlphaPhoenix explores how phase diagrams are useful to understand how multiple inputs that are under the user's control map to outcomes. This is often used in physics to describe how inputs such as tempertaure and pressure yield phases of matter, however this idea can be extended to any input-outcome scenario. This is explored by applying the idea to golf, where inputs are swing speed and angle, and the output is the final distance of the ball from the hole.

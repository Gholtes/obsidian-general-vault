Street cleaning requires the cleaner to visit all streets, leading to the problem of planning a route that visits all edges in the road network graph while minimising total distance traveled. This is different to usual route finding problems where there are a small number of destinations relaive to the number of nodes and edges available to traverse the network. 

This problem is also known as the [[chinese postman problem]].
This problem can be contrasted with the [[travelling salesperson problem]].

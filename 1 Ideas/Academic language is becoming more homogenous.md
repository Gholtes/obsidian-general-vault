A 2021 paper by Leif Rasmussen showed that the [[cosine similairity]] measures of the [[word embedding vectors]] of the language used in scientific papers indicates that the language being used is becoming more homogenous - this indicates that papers are using the same words and language. Despite the use of words associated with diversity increasing by 2.9%, the overall language used is trending towards being less diverse.

This can be taken to suggest that the ideas being put forward in papers may be less diverse, with a possible decline in the quality of research.

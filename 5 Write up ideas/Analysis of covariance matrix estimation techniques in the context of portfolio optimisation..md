Structure:

1. Explain the key issues with [[sample covariance matrix]]
2. Explore the range of solutions, high level overview of methods
3. Define the various methods to be analysed
4. Quantitive analysis:
	1. Gather data on a range of asset classes and iterate over time. Each month:
	2. Estimate the correlation matrix with each method
	3. Estimate an optimal portfolio with [[Portfolio Optimisation]]
	4. Compute returns for the month

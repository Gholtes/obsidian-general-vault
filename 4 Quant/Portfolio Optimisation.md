Aims to find a set of weights, w, on assets, a, such that the portfolio of (a,w) is optimal under a given objective function and set of constraints.

Methods:
- [[Mean-Variance optimisation]]
- [[Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimisation]]

Often requires assumptions about asset returns, in multi-asset cases this can be [[Capital Market Assumptions]]

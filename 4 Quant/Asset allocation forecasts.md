Uses assumed return properties of asset classes to predict how the asset allocation of a portfolio will change over time. Also requires knowledge of:
1. How each asset class can be rebalanced
2. Known contributions or distributions from unlisted asset classes

Often uses [[Capital Market Assumptions]] as a key input.

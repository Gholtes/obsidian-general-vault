Instead of estimating the full covariance matrix, factor models decompose the data into common factors and idiosyncratic contributions. [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]] or [[Factor Analysis]] are examples of such models. The covariance structure is then estimated based on the factors and idiosyncratic variances

Collecting recipes is a lovely way to collate recipes and create a personal "cookbook". Usual methods such as printing or photocopying recipes results in a pretty disorganised collection.

## Step 1: Collect
Collect recipes and save digitally in a simple structured text format - eg YAML. Organise with tags on course, type, etc.

Maybe collect pictures of the recipes as well. 

## Step 2: Save
Save recipes in a repository, eg github

## Step 3: Format and share
Create a tool to format the recipes from the repository into a book or website

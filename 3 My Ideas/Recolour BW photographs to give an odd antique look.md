## Background
- BW photographs used to look "old", but now its so common that the affect has faded.
- ML based recolouring is commonly used to recolour old photographs
- ML based recolouring leaves interesting artefacts such as muted and incorrect colours.

## Idea:
Take photographs of scenes with a modern context in black and white, then recolour these with ML based tools, ideally rather bad tools to maximise the effect.

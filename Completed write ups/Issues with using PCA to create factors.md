[[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]] is a tempting method to create factors for [[Factor Analysis]], but the estimation of PCA requires a covariance matrix, which may create issues for the usage of the factors in [[Factor Models for Covariance Matrix Estimation]].

**Key question:** Do issues in covariance matrix estimate lead to inferior factors when using PCA to create factors, and can better [[Covariance matrix estimation]] methods be used in place of the [[sample covariance matrix]]?

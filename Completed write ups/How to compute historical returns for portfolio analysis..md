How to compute a series of returns on an asset, to then compute `expected return` and `volitility`. Has applications in forming the inputs for [[4 Quant/Portfolio Optimisation]] and [[Covariance matrix estimation]].

## Potential methods:
- Daily returns, annualised - maximises information from series, no overlap
- Rolling annual returns - has issues
- Annual returns with no overlap

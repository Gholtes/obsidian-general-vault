ReactiveX implements the [[observer pattern]] #programming-paradigm. It "support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronisation, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O."

ReactiveX can be used in a wide variety of languages, with rxpy providing the Python API.

ReactiveX impliments the [[observer pattern]] #programmingparadigm. It "support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O."

ReactiveX can be used in a wide variety of langages, with rxpy providing the Python API.

#tensorflow DeepLab is a CNN that provides [[semantic segmentation]] with low latency, even when running on mobile device CPUs. This allows for realtime inference on videos to show segmentation in digital viewfinders. 

At a high level DeepLab uses an encoder-decoder architecture to predict the category of every pixel in the input image.

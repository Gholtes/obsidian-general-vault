The Fourier transform of a signal transforms the signal from the time or spacial domain to the frequency domain. Practically this describes the frequencies that make up the signal and their magnitude. 

Computationally, the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) is used to quickly perform this decomposition of a signal. As frequency information in a signal often changes over time, the FFT is often computed on short segments of the signal, or as a sliding window.
